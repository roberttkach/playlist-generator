This Python script allows you to generate a playlist of all MP3 files located in a specified directory and its subdirectories.

## Usage

1. Open the script in a text editor.
2. Update the `directory` variable with the path to the directory containing your favorite songs.
3. Save the script and run it using a Python interpreter.

The script will print the complete paths of all MP3 files found in the specified directory and its subdirectories.

## How it Works

The script defines a function called `create_playlist` that takes a directory path as an argument. Here's what the function does:

1. It initializes an empty list called `playlist`.
2. It uses the `os.walk` function to recursively traverse the specified directory and its subdirectories.
3. For each file found during the traversal, it checks if the file has the `.mp3` extension.
4. If the file is an MP3 file, it constructs the complete path of the file using `os.path.join` and appends it to the `playlist` list.
5. After traversing all directories and files, the function returns the `playlist` list containing the paths of all MP3 files.

In the main part of the script, it calls the `create_playlist` function with the specified `directory` and stores the result in the `playlist` variable.

Finally, it iterates over the `playlist` list and prints each song path.

## Dependencies

This script uses the `os` module, which is part of the Python standard library. No additional dependencies are required.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/favorite/songs` with the actual path to the directory containing your favorite songs.
- The script assumes that all MP3 files have the `.mp3` extension. If you have MP3 files with different extensions, you'll need to modify the `file.endswith(".mp3")` condition accordingly.
- This script only generates a list of song paths. If you want to play the songs, you'll need to integrate it with a media player or an additional library.
